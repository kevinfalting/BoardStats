# BoardStats

### To run source

```
git clone https://github.com/kevinfalting/BoardStats.git boardstats
cd boardstats
npm install
npm start
```

### To build

after cloning the code down...

```
npm i -g electron-packager
electron-packager .
```

Set to always start on startup, and it will keep track of every key you press. Would like to eventually do some cool stats, maybe even display a heatmap of the keyboard or something. For now, this is just my first electron app. Enjoy.
